# dhis2org-prototype
This is a repo of design prototypes for the DHIS2.org website redesign. These are non-functional design specs intended to communciate layout, styles and breakpoints.

### Grid 
The grid-system is [Bootstrap grid](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). All components are built according this system. The components are often set up with the correct breakpoint sizes, for example `col-md-10 co-lg-8`.

### Functionality
This is **not** a functional prototype. Interactive elements, like menu items, do not work. This prototype should be used for design specs only: spacing, colors, fonts etc.
